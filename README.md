# Single-Cell-classification

  Single-cells are the functional, structural units of all living organisms. The transcriptome of single cell can reveal significant information for studying cellular states and heterogeneity within populations of cells.

  In this work, we introduced two kinds of neural networks: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the single-cell cycle stage based on transcriptome data.
